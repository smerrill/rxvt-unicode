manpagesection(MOUSE REPORTING)

To temporarily override mouse reporting, for either the scrollbar or the
normal text selection/insertion, hold either the Shift or the Meta (Alt) key
while performing the desired mouse action.

If mouse reporting mode is active, the normal scrollbar actions are disabled
-- on the assumption that we are using a fullscreen application.
Instead, pressing Button1 and Button3 sends
bf(ESC[6~) (Next) and bf(ESC[5~) (Prior), respectively.
Similarly, clicking on the up and down arrows sends bf(ESC[A) (Up) and
bf(ESC[B) (Down), respectively.
